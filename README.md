--------------

The red sun in our hearts  
Shines a piece of red to the borders of the motherland  
One hundred thousand miles singing loud and clear  
Feet tread on the flying red flag in highlands  
One thousand rivers.... run into the sea  
Ten thousand sunflowers open towards the sun  
Yanbian people indulge in singing  
Our hearts' red sun  
Oh.... Chairman Mao  
We love you indefinitely  
Your teachings are kept in our hearts  
Yanbian people wish you  
Longevity with no boundaries, longevity of years with no boundaries
